What happened yesterday prepared me for today. 

Every time I wake up in the morning, I'm reminded of
the wonderful gift that life provides. All of my successes---being alive for
another day, the marriage to my beautiful wife, my inspiration to help the
world, my motivation to learn and grow, and my passion to share my knowledge with
others---all of this did not occur by accident. Rather it resulted in a long
series of the choices I've made in response to the challenges (and opportunities)
presented to me over the years. Thinking back, many of these challenges seemed
insurmountable at the time. Now, I realize these challenges were the fiery
forges that made me who I am today. I've grown stronger through struggle. 

Our lives are a journey and who we are today is a history
of the choices we've made along the way. Interesting things happen at the edges
of our comfort zones. A great mystery lies beyond. The things that happen to
us---whether we see them as good or bad---provide us with an opportunity for a
deeper understanding of ourselves. Ultimately, how we choose to respond to life's
challenges are what define us.
