Six Ways to Make the Most of Your Exercise

I've finally discovered what it takes to achieve optimal fitness. I've spent many years working with clients as a personal trainer, movement therapist, and sports coach. In that time, I've learned how to truly teach people how to take care of their bodies. Unlike some trainers who would give you exercises that isolate muscles (biceps, triceps, abs, butt, etc.) or companies that would sell you expensive equipment, I take a movement-centered approach to fitness. In other words I begin working with every client by asking him or her a question:Subject: 6 ways to make the most of your exercise

**What do you want to be able to do?**

This question while simple is the most important question you should be asking yourself. But I don't stop there... 

I'm about to tell you how you can **build optimal strength, flexibility and coordination **regardless of your current fitness level or ability.

As a movement coach, I think about what are the fundamental human movement patterns---the physical skills or attributes that nearly all great athletes and movers possess, then I teach you how to develop these same patterns 

I call these patterns the Primordial Movements because they are physical skills that have been a basic part of human movement for a long time. In our prehistoric past, our ancestors developed them to survive. In the modern world these movements have been declining in most people. We are losing our potential as extraordinary movers because we sit too much and limit our physical activities solely to the things we already good at. When it comes to challenging ourselves with new activities, we are afraid to fail. We avoid stepping our of our comfort zones and as a result drastically reduce the exciting and rich diversity of kinesthetic experience we could be having. 

Over the years our neglect of our bodies speeds aging, reduces vitality, decreases overall health. 

So are you ready to find out the six ways you can optimize you potential as a lifelong mover? Okay, read on.

The 6 Domains of Primordial Movement

****

**1\. **Walking & Running

You might have already guessed this one but it's important to recognize that proper instruction and adequate practice of good walking and running form are important if we want to be able to stay healthy and functional throughout our lives.

**2\. **Balancing

The ability to remain balanced with your center of mass over the base of support (in most cases your feet) is of upmost importance. This is increasingly important if we work or play in ways that involve dynamic movements. Also, our ability to balance tends to decline with age. This can lead to a greater chance of falling and injuring ourselves over time.

**3\. **Jumping

This is another valuable
skill to work on improving. Jumping gives us greater athletic prowess. When trained correctly, jumping is also very good for increasing bone density and joint strength.

These first three Primordial Movement may seem like no-brainers. We all have seen the high level of physical prowess demonstrated in athletes' abilities to run far or fast, jump high, or demonstrate uncanny degrees of balance and agility. However, this is only a part of the picture. The next three Primordial Movements might surprise you. They are...

**4\. **Climbing & Swinging

The design of our shoulder, arms and hands predisposes us to have a high degree of climbing. We only need look at the grip strength of infants or the way children play on the playground to know this. The regular activity of climbing and hanging by our arms is wonderful for enhancing overall athleticism. It is also important for maintain shoulder and spinal health.

**5\. **Crawling

One of the most basic forms of Primordial Movement involves moving comfortably and efficiently on all fours. For many of us, it has been awhile since we moved around this way. However, just as it is for infants, crawling it is the foundation of all other forms of body movement. It develops a high-degree of coordination, as well as upper-body and abdominal strength.

**6\. **Falling Safely and Rolling

Knowing how to fall safely is one of the most important skills in athletics, yet it is the most neglected aspect of physical education. The risk of falling extends beyond sports and recreation. Let's face it---we all know someone who's twisted an ankle stepping off a curb or slipping on ice. Sooner or later, you will take a spill. Instead of waiting for the ground to hit you in the face, you should take the time to learn how to fall in a way that minimizes injury.

Primordial Movement Makes Fitness Fun

The great thing about the Primordial Movements is that they are fun. Moreover, you don't have to be good at them to start incorporating them into your life. If any of them are intimidating to you, you can always start from the very beginning. The 6 domains of Primordial Movements can and should be used to design your personal exercise and fitness plan. So whether you are an athlete, a fitness enthusiast, or someone who just wants to experience more pain-free freedom of movement you're going to want to start working on them. Each of the Primordial Movements will help you develop as a whole-body mover. If you don't challenge the Primordial Movements they won't get better and you'll find yourself aging faster and losing function of your body with time. However, if you spend even a few minutes a day working on some of the movement you'llincrease your physical performance in every thing you do.
