In my lifelong quest for freedom of movement, I've sought out the very best methods, techniques and strategies that are available. Primordial Movement combines everything I've learned from over 20 years of practicing and teaching others better ways to move. It's a family of fundamental movements that allow you to build and maintain functional strength, dynamic flexibility, and extraordinary agility for the rest of your life. Now I've created an online personal training program unlike any other that works your whole body in a dynamic and interconnected way. You too can experience the best of what I've learned no matter where you are in the world.
